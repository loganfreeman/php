module
---
*Modules* are self-contained software units that consist of models, views, controllers, and other supporting components. 

End users can access the controllers of a module when it is installed in application. For these reasons, modules are often viewed as mini-applications. 

Modules differ from applications in that modules cannot be deployed alone and must reside within applications.
